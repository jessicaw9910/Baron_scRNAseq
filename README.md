# Single cell analysis of pancreatic cells

[Baron et al. (Cell Syst. 3 (4):346–60)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5228327/) performed droplet-based single cell experiments of pancreatic cells from four human donors and two mice. Using this data they identify the primary cellular composition of the pancreas including endocrine cells (alpha, beta,…), acinar, ductal, endothelial, and immune cells. 

The assignment is to perform single-cell analysis of this data towards identifying the cell composition of the human pancreas. The end goal is to generate an annotated plot of cellular composition.

The assignment is due at the end of the course in the form of a single R file (or Rmd) that can be run in Rstudio.

Through the analysis you will get familiarized with scRNA data, common data structures used in this analysis, various algorithms and visualization approaches.
